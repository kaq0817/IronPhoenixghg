  <h2 style="color:#FF10F0;">A Real Brand, Built By a Real Person</h2>
  <p style="font-size:1.13rem;line-height:1.65;">
    Hi, I’m the founder of Iron Phoenix.  
    I went to Eisenberg School of Business, but after losing my mother in my junior year, I left to raise my sons.  
    I later worked in home healthcare, but after a tough relapse in 2016, I struggled to find my footing. Out of boredom and the need to create, I discovered Canva, then Etsy—but quickly learned those big platforms mostly help those who can afford to throw money at ads and expensive tools.

    After my husband lost his job to a fire and we couldn’t get help, I knew I needed a new path. That’s why I’m building this brand myself, despite the scammers and “helpers” who promise shortcuts but only take advantage. Iron Phoenix is my stand against the odds—and a way to support my family and mental wellness.

    Every order you place here supports a real person, not a corporation.  
    Thank you for being here and helping prove that small brands still matter.

    — <em>Your Founder</em>
